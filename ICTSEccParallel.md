# A catalog of numerical relatiity simulations being run at ICTS-TIFR Bengaluru

The numerical simulations are being run on the sonic cluster. They contain details of ongoing, already completed and failed runs till date.

This page was first created on Feb 20, 2024.

## Some notes:
1. Codes developed in `waveformtools` help in finding and automatically parsing parameters from NR simulation directories, and output a markdown table here. The code can be [accessed here](https://gitlab.com/vaishakp/waveformtools/-/tree/sxs_wtools/waveformtools/sxs?ref_type=heads). Note: to be possibly moved to gwnrtools.
2. Codes developed in `waveformtools` can also find and process waveforms. They can
  - extrapolate waveforms using scri / waveformtools
  - Apply CoM corrections
3. Some tables are repeated to enable easy viewing of variable amount of information.
4. Failed sumulations: these have failed a cycle or two since the start.

GPU notes

1. Nvidia A100 gives 9.7TFLOPS at FP64. 
2. AMD EPYC processors give around 5.7TFLOPS. Sonic 7352 gives 2.4 TFLOPS per node.
3. Thus at 64-bit arithmetic, using GPUs can at most give 2x speed improvement.
4. This improvement is only for high-end GPUs. NVIDIA e.g. does not support FP64 for many low-end GPUs
5. 32-bit arithmetic with no FMA gives significantly more errors.
6. The speedup using GPUs is easily attainable with compiler optimizations on CPUs 
7. For mixed precision or 32-bit precision, A100 gives around 19TFLOPS

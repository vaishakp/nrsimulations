GPU notes

1. Nvidia A100 gives 9.7TFLOPS at FP64. 
2. AMD EPYC processors give around 5.7TFLOPS
3. Thus at 64bit arithmatic, using GPUs can atmost give 2x speed improvement.
4. This improvement is only for high-end GPUs. NVIDIA e.g. does not support FP64 for many low-end GPUs
5. 32bit arithmatic with no FMA give significantly more errors.
6. The sppedup using GPUs is easily attainable with compiler optimizations on CPUs
